summary: "Some tips from Tim Ferris and motivational quote."
---

Up until march of 2021 I was doing alright in my life and keeping good habits, writing regurlarly in my blog, exercising 3 times a week and even playing guitar some days of the week. Since then I have slipped up big time and I have not been doing any of that, only working and eating and repeating.

So this post is an attempt to motivate myself to get back on track. Tim Ferris has a [very useful video about the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmgl_bT9_vc), that I gonna summarized here:

1. Expect it to happen. Don't be hard on yourself. Ruts will come in your life, and a lot of them. The same way as streaks of having good habits. So having those ebbs and flows are pretty much part of life and one have to learn to be okay with that fact.
2. Have a plan for after slipping up. Since it is going to happen, you have to be ready to get back on track. You can have a plan to start again with baby steps, like exercising only 5 minutes the first day.
3. Try meditation. Tim reccommends Sam Harris app but I believe any type of meditation could help. Meditation is useful because it helps you to stay in the present moment and let go of the past, and for me the harderst part of getting back on track is to stop feeling guilty about all the time I have wasted in the year and begin again with a fresh mind.

If I could add another point not mentioned by Tim is that every low period in your life has some positive stuff as well, maybe some good habits you do so automatically that you are not even aware of them anymore, in my case is reading and learning. One should try to be aware of the good things already present in your life.

I will end this post with a quote a saw today and liked it a lot.

> We’re in a freefall into future. We don’t know where we’re going. Things are changing so fast, and always when you’re going through a long tunnel, anxiety comes along. And all you have to do to transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a voluntary act. It’s a very interesting shift of perspective and that’s all it is… joyful participation in the sorrows and everything changes.
